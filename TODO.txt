Fix the puzzle board size, regardless of how many pieces of it has (currently 1 piece = 1 unit, so less pieces means a smaller board)

Allow the user to manually drag the tiles instead of just clicking to move them

Add sound effects for moving pieces, background music, victory message, etc

Allow moving the empty slot with keyboard
