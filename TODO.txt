Before shuffling, depending on the difficulty, make certain tiles untouchable so they're locked in place and already correct

Allow the user to manually drag the tiles instead of just clicking to move them

Add sound effects for moving pieces, background music, victory message, etc

Allow moving the empty slot with keyboard

Add a drop shadow / frame effect to the tiles

Add an animation / let the user drag in the final piece when the rest of the puzzle is correct

Add UI for:
	Selecting the puzzle graphic < o o o x o >
	Resetting the puzzle
	Toggling music / sound effects
	Auto-solve: Find the correct solution
	Hint: find the next optimal move
	Music jukebox: next song, volume, etc
	Title graphic
