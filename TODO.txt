Before shuffling, depending on the difficulty, make certain tiles untouchable so they're locked in place and already correct

Add a drop shadow / frame effect to the tiles


Add UI for:
	Resetting the puzzle to the original config ( need seed)
	Auto-solve: Find the correct solution
	Hint: find the next optimal move
	Music jukebox: next song, volume, etc
	message "Puzzle completed! Time: 203s - Moves: 39"

make the random graphic selector prefer graphics that haven't been used yet (need to keep a list of used ones)
	
make board constant size for all board sizes

make the final piece wiggle to get the user's attention

add bokeh snow to the background
maybe colour it based on the colour of the current graphic

add background noise, wind, etc
maybe pair each graphic with a preset noise clip, wind for outdoors, booming noise for underwater, etc

maybe move the size / command bar to the right side and make it bigger, easier for mobile use

add mobile touch controls and make sure the UI scales properly with any screen size

allow changing the board background (wooden floor)

allow adjusting the opacity of the number plates on the tiles

trim audio file starts

add a button to toggle between random/ordered playthrough of the puzzles

add a previous button to go back to the previous graphic

add persistent memory for settings (audio volumes)
