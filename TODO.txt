Before shuffling, depending on the difficulty, make certain tiles untouchable so they're locked in place and already correct

Add background music

Add a drop shadow / frame effect to the tiles


Add UI for:
	Resetting the puzzle to the original config ( need seed)
	Toggling music / sound effects
	Auto-solve: Find the correct solution
	Hint: find the next optimal move
	Music jukebox: next song, volume, etc
	Title graphic
	message "Puzzle completed! Time: 203s - Moves: 39"

make the random graphic selector prefer graphics that haven't been used yet (need to keep a list of used ones)

	
make board constant size for all board sizes

make audio players an independent object so they are not destroyed upon board destruction

make the final piece wiggle to get the user's attention

add bokeh snow to the background
maybe colour it based on the colour of the current graphic

add background noise, wind, etc
maybe pair each graphic with a preset noise clip, wind for outdoors, booming noise for underwater, etc
